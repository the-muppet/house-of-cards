## What you will ***not*** find in this repository:
  - Best Practices
  - Proper Documentation
  - Specifications

## What you ***will*** find in this repository:
  - Questionable, but effective *(mostly)* scripts for TCG/MTG... ***STUFF*** üòÖ
  - Works in progress
  - Abandoned projects
  - **Inappropriate** language within docstrings and comments
  - Gruul Smash programming written in Python, JavaScript and Go

## None of my progress would be possible if not for:
# REDBULL, HONEYBUNS, and MYSELF
### and maybe ADHD
### But! ... I do give credit to the following individuals:
 - Chris Pachulski:
     - For staying true to his word, given long before ever meeting me; And for making things nice and Tidy.
 - Vittorio Giovara:
     - For successfully showing me how to think programatically... while *unsucessfully* teaching me Golang.
       <sub>Its not your fault lol</sub>
 - Zach Halpern:
     - For curating and maintaining an unrivalled wealth of MTG data and documentation; And for answering all my dumb questions at ungodly hours
  
***And special thanks to Captain Joe Nasti for filled carts and slash commands*** üòâ
